== Description ==

Recommended Products for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to show a cross sell of recommended products when viewing downloads or the checkout screen, with just a couple of checkboxes. These aren’t “related products” but specifically chosen products based off your stores previous sales. Every night, the recommendations are refreshed to include the day’s sales. You can manually run the update script as well via the Easy Digital Downloads Misc Settings
